Excited to meet so many interesting guys in Penn State. Can't wait to start my new life as a physics phd.

# Campus
The campus of PSU is amazing. I guess it is 4 times larger than PKU at least. I just feels like there's no end of the campus. What a wonder experience to walk along the main lane in Penn State and enjoy the beautiful view. Below is the photo of "The Old Main"

I was just noticed I passed the exemption exam of theoretical mechanics. Can't wait to start my new life. WE ARE!!!
